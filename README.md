# up2axisjoystick
Micropython two axis analog joystick driver.  
- Automatic x,y position polling with application callback or manual polling modes
- Reports position in either raw 0-65,534 u16 count or multi-tiered up/down/left/right states
- Independently reversible x and y axis to match wiring of joystick potentiometers
- Adjustable center 'dead zone'  

## Usage
There are two primary usage patterns: 1) internal driver polling of x,y position with application callback or 2) manual polling of x,y position from applicaiton.

### Internal Driver Polling of x,y Position With Application Callback
In this mode of operation the driver polls the x,y position at a specified rate and updates the application via a callback.

```python
from two_axis_analog_joystick import TwoAxisAnalogJoystick

# Joystick callback
def stick_cb(val):
    x = val[0]
    y = val[1]
    print("x count:", x)
    print("y count:", y)
    
# x potentiometer on pin 26, y potentiometer on pin 27, make measurement every 100ms and return raw x,y counts    
stick = TwoAxisAnalogJoystick(26, 27, polling_ms=100, callback=stick_cb, callback_ret_raw=True)
stick.StartPolling()

# ...
# stick.StopPolling()
```

### Manual Polling of x,y Position From Application
In this mode of operation the application polls the driver for the current x,y position.

```python
from two_axis_analog_joystick import TwoAxisAnalogJoystick
import time

# x potentiometer on pin 26, y potentiometer on pin 27    
stick = TwoAxisAnalogJoystick(26, 27)

while True:
    val = stick.GetRawCount()
    x = val[0]
    y = val[1]
    print("x count:", x)
    print("y count:", y)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## x,y Position Reporting Types
The driver can return the x,y position in raw 0-65,534 u16 counts or in mult-tiered up/down/left/right states.

### Raw u16 Output
If using internal driver polling with application callback, set the ```callback_ret_raw parameter``` to True to receive 'raw' values.  The callback parameter will be a list containing two values. If using the manual polling mode, call ```GetRawCount()``` to return a list containing two values.  The first item in the list will be the raw x value (0-65,534) and the second item in the list will be the raw y value (0-65,534).  

With the joystick in resting centered position, the raw x,y values should each be approximately 1/2 the maximum count (i.e. [32,766, 32,766]).  Moving the joystick to the left or right should increase or decrease the x count depending on how your potentiometers are wired.  The same is true of the y count when moving the joystick up and down.  The exact count values of center, fully up/down, fully left/right will vary depending on several factors including the resolution of your system's A/D, A/D reference voltage range and quality of the potentiometers and joystick construction.

Raw output may be obtained by calling ```GetRawCount()``` anytime or by specifying ```callback_ret_raw=True``` at initialization when using callbacks; the return value will be a list containing two elements, the u16 x count followed by the u16 y count.

### Mult-tiered up/down/left/right States
An alternative to raw x,y counts are multi-tiered up/down/left/right states.  In this mode each cardinal direction (up/down/left/right) is split into three equally\* sized regions, MAX, MID, and MIN (see **Image 1, 2**).  

\*The Dead Zone lies at the very center and is subtracted from the total size of MIN.

The divisions between the regions are determined by the values of x1-x8 and y1-y8 (see **Image 3**).

In its default state, the driver assigns the following values to x1-x8 and y1-y8:
| Marker       | Raw Count Value       |
|------------- | --------------------- |
|  x1, y1      |   0x0000 (0d)         |
|  x2, y2      |   0x2AAA (10,922d)    |
|  x3, y3      |   0x5554 (21,844d)    |
|  x4, y4      |   0x7AFE (31,486d)    |
|  center      |   0x7FFE (32,766d)    |
|  x5, y5      |   0x84FE (34,046d)    |
|  x6, y6      |   0xAAAA (43,690d)    |
|  x7, y7      |   0xD554 (54,612d)    |
|  x8, y8      |   0xFFFE (65,534d)    |
|**Table 1: Region Boundary Raw Count Mapping**|

The x and y states are determined independently depending on which region the x,y coordinates lie between when measured.  States corresponding to x will be MIN/MID/MAX variants of LEFT and RIGHT.  States corresponding to y will be MIN/MID/MAX variants of UP and DOWN.  When the x,y coordinates lie in the dead zone the CENTERED state is returned.  The MIN/MID/MAX regions can be thought of as three ranges of joystick deflection.  MIN represents a joystick delfected just beyond the dead zone of center.  MID represents a joystick deflected approximately half way through its available travel.  MAX represents a joystick deflected approximately full travel.  

* MAX Region 
  * If x1 <= x_measured < x2 then ```SS_LEFT_MAX``` stick state is returned
  * If y1 <= y_measured < y2 then ```SS_DOWN_MAX``` stick state is returned
  * If x7 <= x_measured <= x8 then ```SS_RIGHT_MAX``` stick state is returned
  * If y7 <= y_measured <= y8 then ```SS_UP_MAX``` stick state is returned

* MID Region 
  * If x2 <= x_measured < x3 then ```SS_LEFT_MID``` stick state is returned
  * If y2 <= y_measured < y3 then ```SS_DOWN_MID``` stick state is returned
  * If x6 <= x_measured < x7 then ```SS_RIGHT_MID``` stick state is returned
  * If y6 <= y_measured < y7 then ```SS_UP_MID``` stick state is returned

* MIN Region 
  * If x3 <= x_measured < x4 then ```SS_LEFT_MIN``` stick state is returned
  * If y3 <= y_measured < y4 then ```SS_DOWN_MIN``` stick state is returned
  * If x5 <= x_measured < x6 then ```SS_RIGHT_MIN``` stick state is returned
  * If y5 <= y_measured < y6 then ```SS_UP_MIN``` stick state is returned

* CENTERED Region (Dead Zone)
  * If x4 <= x_measured < x5 then ```SS_CENTERED``` stick state is returned
  * If y4 <= y_measured < y5 then ```SS_CENTERED``` stick state is returned

State output may be obtained by calling ```GetCurrentState()``` anytime or by specifying ```callback_ret_raw=False``` at initialization when using callbacks; the return value will be a list containing two elements, the const x state followed by the const y state.  The values listed in **Table 1** presume that the potentiometers of the joystick are wired with a specific polarity.  The x and y axis values can be independently reversed to match other potentiometer wiring polarities as discussed in the next section.

## Reversal Of x,y States
The x,y states returned by ```GetCurrentState()``` or by specifying ```callback_ret_raw=False``` at initialization, when using callbacks, can be independently reversed to match joystick potentiometer wiring by supplying ```reverse_x=True``` or ```reverse_y=True``` at initialization or by calling ```ReverseX()``` or ```ReverseY()``` anytime.  Reversal only applies to returned x,y states and does not effect raw x,y count values.

## Dead Zone Adjustment
The dead zone is determined by taking the midpoint count 0x7FFE (32,766d) and adding/subtracting the driver default or user supplied dead zone value (see **Table 1** x4/x5 and y4/y5 values).  The driver default dead zone value is 0x0500 (1,280d).  This value may be changed by supplying ```deadzone=new_value``` at initialization; the ```deadzone``` value must be selected such that the midpoint count 0x7FFE (32,766d) +/- the ```deadzone``` value does not exceed the values of x3/x6 and y3/y6.

## Examples
The following is a simple example of using the internal driver polling (100ms between measurements) with a callback which returns the joystick x,y states.  A persistent pixel is moved around a 128x128 px SD1327 based OLED display.  The rate at which the pixel moves is determined by the x,y state; CENTERED results in no change, MIN deflections of the joystick result in 1 pixel 'jumps', MED deflections 3 pixel 'jumps' and MAX deflections 6 pixel 'jumps' each 100ms.  This example was created and tested on a Raspberry PICO.
